      summary: Step 8 - Accept service agreement with PDF generation (Final step)
      description: |
        **Final step** - Visitor accepts service agreement. System automatically generates a personalized PDF agreement, uploads it to Cloudinary, and emails a copy to the visitor.


         **What happens:**
         1. Validates visitor has completed all previous steps (details, estimate, etc.)
         2. Generates PDF with client service agreement including:
           - Client name and pricing
           - Platform terms & conditions
           - Service terms
           - Payment terms (full upfront, no refunds)
           - IP ownership
           - Liability limitations
           - Dispute resolution
         3. Uploads PDF to Cloudinary
         4. Stores document URL in database with audit trail
         5. Emails copy to visitor


         **Note:** Estimate must be calculated (Step 7) before accepting agreement.
         After accepting this agreement, visitor can proceed to register as a client.
