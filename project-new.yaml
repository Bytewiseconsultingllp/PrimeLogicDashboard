      summary: Create a new project (existing clients)
      description: |
        Allows an authenticated client to create a new project. This endpoint is for existing clients who want to add additional projects to their account.

        **Key Features:**
        - Client ID is automatically extracted from authentication token
        - **All fields required** - same as visitor flow (details, services, industries, technologies, features, discount, timeline, estimate, service agreement)
        - Complete project information must be provided upfront

        **What's Different from Visitor Flow:**
        - No visitor conversion needed - client already registered
        - visitorId will be null (this is a direct client project)
        - Same comprehensive data requirements as visitor flow

      summary: Toggle accepting bids status
      description: |
        Control whether a project is accepting new bids from freelancers.

        **Key Features:**
        - When `acceptingBids = true`: Project is visible to all freelancers who meet requirements
        - When `acceptingBids = false`: Project is hidden from freelancers who are not already assigned

        **Visibility Logic for Freelancers:**
        - **Assigned freelancers**: Can ALWAYS see the project (regardless of `acceptingBids` status)
        - **Non-assigned freelancers**: Can only see if `acceptingBids = true` AND `paymentStatus = "SUCCEEDED"`

        **Authorization:**
        - Client: Can toggle their own projects
        - Moderator: Can toggle any project
        - Admin: Can toggle any project

        **Use Cases:**
        - Close bidding after finding enough freelancers
        - Reopen bidding if more freelancers are needed
        - Temporarily pause bidding while evaluating current applicants

      summary: Create project from visitor data
      description: |
        Internal endpoint used when a visitor registers as a client. This automatically converts all visitor data into a project.

        **Flow:**
        1. Visitor fills out project details through the visitor flow
        2. Visitor registers as a client
        3. This endpoint is called automatically to convert visitor data to project

        **Note:** This is typically called by the backend during the registration process, not directly by the frontend.
